# The models
The control model was gonogo_10n_decision.py, wherein all states had 10 neurons per dimension.

The NPR model was gonogo_5n_decision.py, wherein all states had 5 neurons per dimension.

The RLR model was gonogo_unseg10n_decision.py, wherein all states had 10 neurons per dimension, and there is increased vocabulary overlap between states.
