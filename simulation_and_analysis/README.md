# Simulations
Nengo simulations were run in Jupyter notebook. TO BE ADDED

# Analysis
This analysis is fairly underwhelming and largely unnecessary. Each runthrough of the model is remarkably similar, as would be expected, but if noise was added prior to each probe that simulated human response data variability, that could provide more interesting results.
Essentially, this just shows how to do an analysis on similar data, had you done a complete model of human data.
